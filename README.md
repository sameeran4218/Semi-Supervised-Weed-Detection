# Weed Detection using Semi-Supervised Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a semi-supervised learning approach for weed detection using YOLOv8. The project leverages a combination of data augmentation, pseudo-labeling, and iterative model training to improve the modelâ€™s performance in detecting weeds in images. The goal was to utilize both labeled and unlabeled data effectively to create a robust weed detection system with minimal labeled data.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to enhance the weed detection model's accuracy by using a semi-supervised learning approach. Initially, the model was trained on a small labeled dataset, followed by data augmentation to artificially expand the dataset. Then, a pseudo-labeling technique was employed, where the trained model predicted labels for unlabeled data with high confidence. These high-confidence predictions were added to the training dataset, and the model was retrained iteratively, resulting in better generalization and weed detection performance.

## Key Features
- **YOLOv8-based weed detection model**: Leveraging the power of YOLOv8 for real-time, high-performance object detection.
- **Semi-Supervised Learning Approach**: Combining labeled and unlabeled data through data augmentation and pseudo-labeling.
- **Iterative Model Training**: The model is retrained multiple times, gradually incorporating pseudo-labeled data to improve its performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for the implementation.
- **YOLOv8**: Deep learning model for object detection.
- **OpenCV**: For image manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks used for model training.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for the model development and training pipeline.

## Approach

### 1. **Data Augmentation**
Data augmentation techniques were applied to the labeled dataset to artificially expand the number of training examples. This included techniques such as image rotation, flipping, and cropping to create diverse variations of the original images. This improved the model's ability to generalize to different weed patterns.

### 2. **Pseudo-Labeling**
Once the initial model was trained on the augmented labeled data, pseudo-labeling was implemented. In this step, the trained model generated predictions for the unlabeled dataset. Only the predictions with a confidence score higher than 0.95 were considered as reliable pseudo-labels. These high-confidence pseudo-labeled samples were added to the training set to augment the labeled data.

### 3. **Iterative Model Training**
The model was trained iteratively. Initially, it was trained on the augmented labeled dataset, and pseudo-labels were incorporated into the training set in subsequent rounds. As more pseudo-labeled data was added, the model became more accurate and effective at detecting weeds.

## Results

The model achieved significant improvements in performance after the incorporation of high-confidence pseudo-labeled data. With the iterative training process, the model became more robust, with a notable increase in accuracy and generalization capability for detecting weeds in various scenarios.

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. **Noise in Pseudo-Labels**
One of the main challenges faced was the potential introduction of noise into the dataset, as some pseudo-labels predicted by the model may have been incorrect. To address this, we set a confidence threshold of 0.95, ensuring that only pseudo-labels with high confidence were added to the training set.

### 2. **Balancing Labeled and Unlabeled Data**
Another challenge was maintaining a balance between labeled and pseudo-labeled data to avoid overfitting to the pseudo-labeled examples. This was mitigated by gradually increasing the proportion of pseudo-labeled data after each training iteration.
